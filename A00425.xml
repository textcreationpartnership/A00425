            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As admit to weigh 21 pound, put unto the thing that is to be <hi>weighed</hi> the 9 pound <hi>weight,</hi> then in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ballance</hi> put 27 pound and 3 pound which doth counterpoiſe 21 pound and 9 pound: and if 20 pound were to be <hi>weighed,</hi> put to it in the <hi>ballance</hi> 9 and 1, and in the other <hi>ballance</hi> put 27 and 3, and ſo of others.</p>

<figure>
                     <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
                  </figure>
and 11 inches on the other ſide: conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that the ſhorter end ſhould be as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy as the longer, a thing eaſie to bee done: then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put into the <hi>ballance</hi> two unequall weights in ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the parts of the <hi>beame</hi> have one unto another, which is 12 to 11; but ſo that the greater be placed in the <hi>ballance</hi> which hangs upon the ſhorter part of the <hi>beame,</hi> and the leſſer weight in the other <hi>ballance:</hi> it is moſt certaine that the <hi>ballances</hi> will hang in <hi>aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio,</hi> which will ſeeme moſt ſincere and juſt; though it bee moſt deceitfull, abominable, and falſe.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this is drawne from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who ſhewes that two unequall weights will counterpoyſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when there is like proportion betweene the parts of the <hi>beame</hi> (that the handle ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates)

and the weights themſelves: for in one and the ſame counterpoiſe, by how much it is farther from the Center of the handle, by ſo much it ſeemes heavier; therefore if there be a diverſitie of diſtance that the <hi>ballances</hi> hang from the handle, there muſt neceſſarily bee an inequallity of weight in theſe <hi>ballances</hi> to make them hang in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> and to diſcover if there be deceite, change the weight into the other <hi>ballance,</hi> for as ſoone as the greater weight is placed in the <hi>ballance</hi> that hangs on the longer parts of the beame: it will weigh downe the other inſtantly.</p>

               <p>IT is ſaid that upon a time paſt, two <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians</hi> meete, and they would make tryall of their induſtry: the one made inſtantly a perfect <hi>circle</hi> without <hi>Compaſſes,</hi> and the other immediately pointed out the <hi>center</hi> thereof with the point of a <hi>needle:</hi> now which is the chiefeſt action: it ſeemes the firſt: for to draw the moſt nobleſt <hi>figure</hi> upon a plaine <hi>Table</hi> without other helpe than the hand, and the minde, is full of admiration: to finde the <hi>center</hi> is but to finde out only one point, but to draw a round, there muſt be almoſt infinite points, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidiſtant from the <hi>center</hi> or middle: that in concluſion it is both the <hi>circle</hi> and the <hi>center</hi> together. But contrarily it may ſeeme that to finde the <hi>center</hi> is more difficult, for what atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vivacitie, and ſubtiltie muſt there be in the ſpirit, in the eye, in the hand, which will chuſe the true point amongſt a thouſand other points? He that makes a <hi>circle</hi> keepes alwayes the ſame diſtance, and is guided by a halfe diſtance to finiſh the reſt; but he that muſt finde the <hi>center,</hi> muſt in the ſame time take heed to the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and chooſe one onely point which is equall diſtant from an infinite of other points which are in the <hi>circumference:</hi> which is very
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8932:60"/>
difficult. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confirmes this amongſt his moralls, and ſeemes to explaine the difficultie which is to be found in the middle of vertue; for it may want a thouſand wayes and be farre ſeparated from the true <hi>center</hi> of the end of a right mediocritie of a vertuous action: for to doe well it muſt touch the middle point which is but one, and there muſt be a true point which reſpects the end, and thats but one onely.

                  <hi>Vilalpandus</hi> treating of the <hi>Temple of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that chiefetaine of workes was modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all of good <hi>Architecture,</hi> and curiouſly to be obſerved in many peeces to keepe the ſame proportion as the body to his parts: ſo that by the greatneſſe of the worke and proportionable <hi>ſymmetrie,</hi> ſome dare aſſure themſelves that by knowledge of one onely part of that <hi>building,</hi> one might know all the meaſures of that goodly ſtructure.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Architects</hi> ſay that the foundation of <hi>houſes,</hi> and baſis of <hi>columnes,</hi> are as the <hi>foote;</hi> the <hi>tôp,</hi> and <hi>roofe</hi> as the <hi>head;</hi> the reſt as the <hi>body:</hi> thoſe which have beene ſomewhat more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, have noted that as in <hi>humaine bodies,</hi> the parts are uniforme as the <hi>noſe,</hi> the <hi>mouth,</hi> &amp;c. theſe which are double are put on one ſide or other, with a perfect equallitie in the ſame <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In like manner,</hi> ſome have beene yet more curious than ſolid; comparing all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a <hi>Corinth</hi> to the parts of the <hi>face,</hi> as the <hi>brow,</hi> the <hi>eyes,</hi> the <hi>noſe,</hi> the <hi>mouth;</hi> the rounding of <hi>pillars,</hi> to the writhing of haire, the chanells of columnes, to the fouldings of womens <hi>robes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>building</hi> being a worke of the beſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> there is much reaſon why man ought to make his imitation from the chiefe worke of nature; which is man.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that <hi>Vitruvious</hi> in his third book,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8932:76"/>
and all the beſt <hi>Architectures,</hi> treateth of the proportion of man; and amongſt others <hi>Albert Dureus</hi> hath made a whole booke of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of mans body, from the foot to the head; let them reade it who will, they may have a perfect knowledge therof: but I will content my ſelfe, and it may ſatisfie ſome with that which followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> the length of a <hi>man</hi> well made, which commonly is called height, is equall to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from one end of his <hi>finger</hi> to the other: when the <hi>armes</hi> are extended as wide as they may be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> if a <hi>man</hi> have his feet and hands extended or ſtretched in forme of S. <hi>Andrewes Croſſe,</hi> placing one foote of a paire of <hi>Compaſſes</hi> upon his <hi>navill,</hi> one may deſcribe a <hi>circle</hi> which will paſſe by the ends of his hands and feet, and drawing lines by the termes of the hands and feet, you have a ſquare within a <hi>circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the breadth of <hi>man,</hi> or the ſpace which is from one ſide to another; the <hi>breaſt,</hi> the <hi>head,</hi> and the <hi>necke,</hi> makes the 6 part of all the <hi>body</hi> taken in length or height.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the length of the <hi>face</hi> is equall to the length of the <hi>hand,</hi> taken from the ſmall of the <hi>arme,</hi> unto the extremity of the longeſt <hi>finger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> the thickeneſſe of the <hi>body</hi> taken from the <hi>belly</hi> to the <hi>backe;</hi> the one or the other is the tenth part of the whole <hi>body,</hi> or as ſome will have, it the ninth part, little leſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly,</hi> the height of the <hi>brow,</hi> the length of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8932:77"/>
the <hi>noſe,</hi> the ſpace betweene the <hi>noſe</hi> and the <hi>chinne,</hi> the length of the <hi>eares,</hi> the greatneſſe of the <hi>thumbe,</hi> are perfectly equall one to the other.</p>
               <p>What would you ſay to make an admirable report of the other parts, if I ſhould reckon them in their leaſt; but in that I deſire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and will rather extract ſome concluſion upon that which is delivered.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place knowing the proportion of a <hi>man,</hi> it is eaſie to <hi>Painters, image</hi>-makers, &amp;c. perfectly to proportionate their worke; and by the ſame is made moſt evident, that which is related of the <hi>images</hi> and ſtatues of <hi>Greece,</hi> that upon a day diverſe workemen having enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make the face of a <hi>man,</hi> being ſevered one from another in ſundry places, all the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made and put together, the face was found in a moſt lively and true proportion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a thing moſt cleare that by the helpe of proportion, the body of <hi>Hercules</hi> was meaſured by the knowledge of his <hi>foote</hi> onely; a <hi>Lyon</hi> by his <hi>claw,</hi> the <hi>Gyant</hi> by his <hi>thumbe,</hi> and a <hi>Man</hi> by any parte of his body. For ſo it was that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> having meaſured the length of <hi>Hercules</hi> foote, by the ſteps which was left upon the <hi>ground,</hi> found out all his height: and ſo it was that <hi>Phydias</hi> having onely the claw of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> did figure and draw out all the beaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his true type or forme; ſo the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Painter <hi>Timantus,</hi> having painted a <hi>Pigmey</hi> or Dwarfe, which he meaſured with a <hi>fadome</hi> made with the intch of a <hi>Gyant;</hi> it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8932:77"/>
to know the greatneſſe of that <hi>Gyant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be ſhort, we may by like methode come eaſily to the knowledge of many fine antiquities touching <hi>Statues, Coloſſes,</hi> and monſtrous <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> onely ſuppoſing one had found but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of them, as the <hi>head,</hi> the <hi>hand,</hi> the <hi>foote,</hi> or ſome bone mentioned in ancient <hi>Hiſtories.</hi>

                  <head>Of Statues, of Coloſſus, or huge images.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VItruvius</hi> relates in his ſecond booke that the <hi>Architect Dinocrates</hi> was deſirous to put out to the world ſome notable thing, went to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and propoſed unto him a high and ſpeciall peece of worke which he had projected: as to figure out the mount <hi>Athos</hi> in forme of a great <hi>Statue,</hi> which ſhould hold in his right hand a <hi>Towne</hi> capable to receive <hi>ten thouſand men:</hi> and in his left hand a <hi>veſſell</hi> to receive all the water that floweth from the <hi>mountaine,</hi> which with an ingine ſhould caſt into the <hi>Sea.</hi> This is a pretty project, ſaid <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> but becauſe there was not field roome thereabout to nouriſh and retaine the <hi>Citizens</hi> of that place, <hi>Alexander</hi> was wiſe not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the deſigne.</p>
                  <p>Now let it bee required of what greatneſſe this <hi>Statue</hi> might have beene, the <hi>Towne</hi> in his right hand, and the receiver of water in his left hand if it had beene made.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Statue,</hi> it could not bee higher than the <hi>mountaine</hi> it ſelfe, and the <hi>mountaine</hi> was about a mile in height plume or perpendicular;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8932:78"/>
therefore the hand of this <hi>Statue</hi> ought to bee the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of his height, which would bee 500 <hi>foote,</hi> and ſo the bredth of his hand would be 250 <hi>foote;</hi> the length now multiplyed by the bredth, makes <hi>an hundred twenty five thouſand ſquare feete;</hi> for the quantitie of his <hi>hand</hi> to make the towne in, to lodge the ſaid 10 <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men,</hi> allowing to each man neere about 12 <hi>foote of ſquare ground:</hi> now judge the capacitie of the other parts of this <hi>Coloſſus</hi> by that which is already delivered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Plinie</hi> in his 34 booke <hi>of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Hiſtory,</hi> ſpeakes of the famous <hi>Coloſſus</hi> that was at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> betweene whoſe legges a <hi>Shippe</hi> might paſſe with his <hi>ſailes</hi> open or diſplayed, the <hi>Statue</hi> being of 70 <hi>cubits high:</hi> and other Hiſtories reports that the <hi>Sarazins</hi> having broken it, did load 900 <hi>Camells</hi> with the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it, now what might be the greatnes and weight of this <hi>Statue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwere it is uſually allowed for a <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mells</hi> burthen 1200 pound weight, therefore all the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> did weigh 1080000 pound weight, which is ten hundred and foreſcore thouſand pound weight.</p>
                  <p>Now according to the former rules, the <hi>head</hi> being the tenth part of the <hi>body,</hi> this <hi>Statues head</hi> ſhould bee of 7 <hi>cubits,</hi> that is to ſay, 10 <hi>foote</hi> and a halfe; and ſeeing that the <hi>noſe,</hi> the <hi>brow,</hi> and the <hi>thumbe,</hi> are the third part of the <hi>face;</hi> his <hi>noſe</hi> was 3 <hi>foote</hi> and a halfe long, and ſo much alſo was his <hi>thumbe</hi> in length: now the thickneſſe being alwayes the third part of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8932:78"/>
the length, it ſhould ſeeme that his <hi>thumbe</hi> was a foote thicke at the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Plinie</hi> in the ſame place reports that <hi>Nero</hi> did cauſe to come out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Itally,</hi> a brave and bold <hi>Statue</hi>-maker called <hi>Zenodocus,</hi> to erect him a <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of <hi>braſſe,</hi> which was made of 120 foot in <hi>height,</hi> which <hi>Nero</hi> cauſed to bee painted in the ſame height. Now would you know the greatneſſe of the members of this <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> the breadth would be 20 <hi>foote,</hi> his <hi>face</hi> 12 <hi>foote,</hi> his <hi>thumbe</hi> and his <hi>noſe</hi> 4 <hi>foote,</hi> according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before delivered.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have a faire <hi>field</hi> or ſubject to extend my ſelfe upon, but it is upon another occaſion that it was undertaken; let us ſpeake therefore a word touching the <hi>Gyants,</hi> and then paſſe away to the matter.</p>

                  <p>YOu will hardly beleeve all that which I ſay touching this, neither will I beleeve all that which <hi>Authors</hi> ſay upon this ſubject: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you nor I cannot deny but that long agoe there hath beene men of a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious greatneſſe; for the <hi>holy writings</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this themſelves in <hi>Deut.

                  </p>
                  <p>So in the firſt of <hi>Kings Chap.</hi> 17. there is

Now it is certaine that the reſt of his <hi>armes</hi> taking his <hi>Target, Helmet, Braſelets,</hi> and other <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> together, did weigh at the leaſt 5 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, a thing prodigious; ſeeing that the ſtrongeſt man that now is, can hardly beare 200 pound, yet this <hi>Gyant</hi> carries this as a <hi>veſture</hi> without paine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solinus</hi> reporteth in his 5 <hi>Chap.</hi> of his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie,</hi> that during the <hi>Grecians</hi> warre after a great overflowing of the <hi>rivers,</hi> there was found upon the ſands the <hi>carkaſſe</hi> of a <hi>man,</hi> whoſe length was 33 <hi>cubits,</hi> (that is 49 <hi>foote</hi> and a halfe) therefore according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion delivered, his <hi>face</hi> ſhould bee 5 <hi>foote</hi> in length, a thing prodigious and monſtrous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 7. booke and 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> ſaith, that in the Ile of <hi>Crete</hi> or <hi>Candie,</hi> a mountaine being cleaven by an <hi>earthquake,</hi> there was a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtanding upright, which had 46 <hi>cubits</hi> of height: ſome beleeves that it was the body of <hi>Orion</hi> or <hi>Othus,</hi> (but I thinke rather it was ſome <hi>Ghoſt</hi> or ſome deluſion,) whoſe <hi>hand</hi> ſhould have beene 7 foote, and his <hi>noſe</hi> two foot and a half long.

where it is thought that the <hi>Gyant Antheus</hi> was buried, <hi>Sertorius</hi> could not beleeve that which was reported of his prodigious greatneſſe, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſepulcher to bee opened, and found that his body did containe 60 <hi>cubits</hi> in length, then by proportion hee ſhould bee 10 <hi>cubits</hi> or 15 foote in bredth; 9 foote for the length of his <hi>face,</hi> 3 foote for <hi>his thumbe,</hi> which is neare the capacitie of the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> at <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Who can beleeve that any man ever had 20 <hi>cubits,</hi> or 30 foote in length for his <hi>face,</hi> and a <hi>noſe</hi> of 10 foote long? but it is very certaine that there hath been men of very great ſtature, as the holy Scriptures before witneſſeth, and many <hi>Authours</hi> worthy of beliefe relateth: <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus Acoſta</hi> in his firſt booke of the <hi>Indian Hiſtory, Chap.</hi> 19. a late writer, reporteth that

From whence comes it, that from the appearances of flat or convex <hi>Glaſſes,</hi> the production and reflection of the ſpecies are explained, is it not by right lines? in the ſame proportion one might ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently deliver the motion of a <hi>balle</hi> or <hi>bowle</hi> by <hi>Geometricall lines</hi> and <hi>Angles.</hi>

               <p>And the firſt <hi>maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> is thus: When a <hi>Bowle</hi> toucheth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bowle,</hi> or when a trapſticke ſtriketh the <hi>Balle,</hi> the moving of the <hi>Balle</hi> is made in a right line, which is drawn from the Center of the <hi>Bowle</hi> by the point of contingencie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> in all kinde of ſuch motion; when a <hi>Balle</hi> or <hi>Bowle</hi> rebounds, be it either againſt <hi>wood,</hi> a <hi>wall,</hi> upon a <hi>Drumme,</hi> a <hi>pavement,</hi> or upon a <hi>Racket;</hi> the incident Angle is alwayes equall to the Angle of reflection.</p>
               <p>Now following theſe <hi>maximes</hi> it is eaſie to conclude, firſt in what part of the wood or wall, one may make the <hi>Bowle</hi> or <hi>Balle</hi> goe to reflect or rebound, to ſuch a place as one would: <hi>Secondly,</hi> how one may caſt a <hi>Bowle</hi> upon another, in ſuch ſort that the firſt or the ſecond ſhall goe and meete with the third, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the reflection or Angle of incidence equall. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> how one may touch a <hi>Bowle</hi> to ſend it to what part one pleaſeth: ſuch and many other practices may bee done.

                     <hi>3.</hi> In the third queſtion it may be asked, how it comes to paſſe, that a Cannon ſhooting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the Bullet flies with more violence than being ſhot point-blanke, or ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downeward.</head>
                  <p>IF we regard the effect of a <hi>Cannon</hi> when it is to batter a <hi>wall,</hi> the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is falſe, ſeeing it is moſt evident that the blowes which fall
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8932:106"/>
perpendicular upon a wall, are more violent than theſe which ſtrikes byaſ-wiſe or glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly.</p>
                  <p>But conſidering the ſtrength of the blow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is moſt true, and often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to be found true: a Peece mounted at the beſt of the <hi>Randon,</hi> which is neare halfe of the right, conveyes her Bullet with a farre greater violence than that which is ſhot at, <hi>Point blanke</hi> or mounted paralell to the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon reaſon is, that ſhooting high, the <hi>fire</hi> carries the <hi>bowle</hi> a longer time in the <hi>aire,</hi> and the <hi>aire</hi> moves more facill upwards, than downewards, becauſe that the <hi>ayrie circles</hi> that the motion of the <hi>bullet</hi> makes are ſooneſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Howſoever this be the generall tenet, it is curious to find out the inequallity of moving of the <hi>aire;</hi> whether the <hi>Bullet</hi> fly upward, downeward, or right forward, to produce a ſencible difference of motion: and ſome thinke that the <hi>Cannon</hi> being mounted, the <hi>Bullet</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Powder</hi> maketh a greatar reſiſtance, and ſo cauſeth all the <hi>Powder</hi> to be inflamed before the <hi>Bullet</hi> is throwne out, which makes it to be more violent than otherwiſe it would be. When the <hi>Cannon</hi> is otherwiſe diſpoſed, the contrary arives, the <hi>fire</hi> leaves the <hi>Bullet,</hi> and and the <hi>Bullet</hi> rouling from the <hi>Powder</hi> reſiſts leſſe: and it is uſually ſeene, that ſhooting out of a <hi>Musket</hi> charged onely with <hi>Powder;</hi> to ſhoote to a marke of <hi>Paper</hi> placed <hi>Point blanke,</hi> that there are ſeene many ſmall holes in the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8932:107"/>
                     <hi>paper,</hi> which cannot be other than the graines of <hi>Powder</hi> which did not take <hi>fire:</hi> but this latter accident may happen from the overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the <hi>Peece,</hi> or the length of it, or windy, or dampeneſſe of the <hi>Powder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which ſome may thinke, that a <hi>Cannon</hi> pointed right to the <hi>Zenith,</hi> ſhould ſhoote with greater violence, than in any other mount or forme whatſoever: and by ſome it hath beene imagined, that a <hi>Bullet</hi> ſhot in this faſhion hath beene conſumed, melt, and loſt in the <hi>aire,</hi> by reaſon of the violence of the <hi>blow,</hi> and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie of the <hi>fire;</hi> and that ſundry experiments hath beene made in this nature, and the <hi>Bullet</hi> never found. <hi>But</hi> it is hard to beleeve this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion: it may rather be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> falling farre from the <hi>Peece</hi> cannot be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned where it falls: and ſo comes to be loſt.</p>

                     <hi>4.</hi> In the fourth place it may be asked, whether the diſcharge of a Cannon be ſo much the greater, by how much it is longer.</head>
                  <p>IT ſeemeth at the firſt to bee moſt true, that the longer the <hi>Peece</hi> is, the more violent it ſhootes: and to ſpeake generally, that which is direction by a <hi>Trunke, Pipe,</hi> or other concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is conveyed ſo much the more violent, or better, by how much it is longer; either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>ſight, hearing, water, fire, &amp;c.</hi> and the reaſon ſeemes to hold in <hi>Cannons,</hi> becauſe in theſe that are long, the <hi>fire</hi> is retained a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time in the concavitie of the <hi>Peece,</hi> and ſo
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8932:107"/>
throwes out the <hi>Bullet</hi> with more violence; and experience lets us ſee that taking <hi>Cannons</hi> of the ſame boare, but of diverſitie of length from 8 foote to 12; that the <hi>Cannon</hi> of 9 foote long hath more force than that of 8 foot long, and 10 more than that of 9, and ſo unto 12 foote of length. Now the uſuall <hi>Cannon</hi> carries 600 <hi>Paces,</hi> ſome more, ſome leſſe; yea, ſome but 200 <hi>Paces</hi> from the <hi>Peece,</hi> and may ſhoote into ſoft earth 15 or 17 foote, into ſand or earth which is looſe, 22 or 24 foote; and in firme ground, about 10 or 12 foot, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It hath beene ſeene lately in <hi>Germany,</hi> where there was made <hi>Peeces</hi> from 8 foote long to 17 foote of like boare, that ſhooting out of any <hi>Peece</hi> which was longer than 12 foote; the force was diminiſhed, and the more in length the <hi>Peece</hi> increaſeth, the leſſe his force was; therefore the length ought to bee in a meane meaſure; and it is often ſeene, the greater the <hi>Cannon</hi> is, by ſo much the ſervice is greater: but to have it too long or too ſhort, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, but a meane proportion of length to bee taken; otherwiſe the flame of the <hi>fire</hi> will bee overpreſſed with <hi>aire:</hi> which hinders the motion in reſpect of ſubſtance, and diſtance of getting out,

                  <p>Now ſome ſay that he tooke two <hi>Maſſes,</hi> the one of pure <hi>Gould,</hi> and the other of pure <hi>Silver,</hi> each equall to the weight of the <hi>Crowne,</hi> and therefore unequall in magnitude or greatneſſe;

                  <p>Some judge the way to bee more facill by weighing the <hi>Crowne</hi> firſt in the <hi>aire,</hi> then in the <hi>water;</hi> in the <hi>aire</hi> it weighed 18 pound, and if it were pure <hi>Gould,</hi> in the <hi>water</hi> it would weigh but 17 pound; if it were <hi>Copper</hi> it would weigh but 16 pound; but becauſe wee will ſuppoſe that <hi>Gould</hi> and <hi>Copper</hi> is mixed together, it will weigh leſſe then 17 pound,

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> it is of a farre higher nature to conſider the exceeding and unmoveable quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>ſtarry firmament,</hi> for a <hi>ſtarre</hi> being in the <hi>Equator,</hi> (which is juſt betweene the <hi>Poles</hi> of the <hi>world</hi>) makes 12598666 miles in one houre, which is <hi>two hundred, nine thouſand nine hundred and ninety foure miles</hi> in one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of time: &amp; if a <hi>Horſeman</hi> ſhould ride every day 40 miles, hee could not ride ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe in a thouſand yeares as the <hi>ſtarry firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> moves in one houre, which is more than if one ſhould move about the <hi>earth</hi> a thouſand
